## Inspiration
Covid resulted in many unwanted effects, however one effect not commonly discussed is how covid led to a rise in gambling addictions. Our inspiration revolved around helping those who struggle with gambling and who had their support/help taken away by covid. Our goal was to create an application that could help those struggling with gambling by allowing them a place where they could get the same thrill but without the adverse effect of losing money. A place where they could reach out to others in the support group for help.

## What it does
Gamble Go Away allows users to achieve the same thrill that one would get from playing gambling games such as the lottery and slot machines but without actually losing money. Users would also be able to reach out to the support group to talk to others in a similar position. Lastly, they can also list down personal thoughts/feelings in the notepad.

## How we built it
This project was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js for the Front-end. For the back-end, we use Firebase. We finally deployed our website on Vercel.

## Challenges we ran into
It was difficult building the project with only two members, and we also had to start later, so we had to cut some of the ideas that we had. Neither of us were experienced in design, so we both had to learn Figma before starting. We also had to go through a lot of videos and documentation to work with Firebase, since the syntax has changed multiple times. We were planning to utilize web-scraping to get the lotto numbers, but we were unable to integrate it into our code.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of creating a website that aims to be helpful to those who are struggling with some sort of gambling addiction. We learnt Figma, practiced our front-end skills, hooked our project up with back-end firebase, and deployed the website!

## What we learned
We improved our overall front-end skills such as React (including JavaScript, HTML, and CSS). We also practiced Firebase authentication and worked with both Firebase cloud-store and Firebase real-time database.

## What's next for Gambling Go Away
Adding payment functionality, adding more games/features, and improving the aesthetics of the website
